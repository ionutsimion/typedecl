C++ strong types, inspired by:
- Jonathan Boccara's series on strong types (https://www.fluentcpp.com/2016/12/08/strong-types-for-strong-interfaces/)
- Pierre Baillargeon's blog post: "Hypotetical C++: easy type creation" (https://www.spiria.com/en/blog/desktop-software/hypothetical-c-easy-type-creation/)
